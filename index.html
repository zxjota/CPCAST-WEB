    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>September 10, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>CPCAST</strong> (the “App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use our mobile application and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By using CPCAST, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Information you provide directly:</strong> Account information, email address, profile name, content you submit, and correspondence with support.</li>
      <li><strong>Device and usage information:</strong> Device model, operating system, unique identifiers (e.g., advertising ID), app usage data, crash reports, and performance metrics.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics and cookies:</strong> Data collected through cookies, local storage, or similar technologies to understand usage patterns and improve the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Location data:</strong> We do not collect precise location data unless you explicitly grant permission. If you enable location features, we may collect coarse or precise location as required to provide those features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for purposes including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving the Service.</li>
      <li>Personalizing features and content.</li>
      <li>Responding to user inquiries and providing customer support.</li>
      <li>Monitoring, analyzing, and improving performance and functionality.</li>
      <li>Detecting, preventing, and addressing security or technical issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We will not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, hosting, crash reporting).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal and safety:</strong> When required by law, to respond to legal process, or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or bankruptcy—users will be notified if their data is transferred and becomes subject to a new privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services that collect, process, and analyze information (for example, analytics or crash-reporting tools). These third parties have their own privacy policies and practices. We recommend reviewing their policies; we are not responsible for their practices.</p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We and our partners may use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to operate the Service, remember preferences, and provide analytics. You can control or disable cookies through device or browser settings, but this may affect functionality.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing agreements. When information is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the information we collect. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal information. To exercise these rights, contact us using the information below. We may require verification before honoring certain requests.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We operate globally. Your information may be transferred to, processed, or stored in countries other than your own. When doing so, we use appropriate safeguards required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Effective date” and provide notice in the App or through other communication channels where required.</p>
